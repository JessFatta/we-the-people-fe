## Description

We The People is a team-project written with the React JavaScript framework in 14 days.

### Summary 

We The People is our Mod 4 capstone project at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/). The capstone project involves developers from the Front End and Back End program working together to create a full-stack application.

We recognize that the 117th Congress of the United States is [more diverse](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/03/10/the-changing-face-of-congress/) than preceding 116 congresses. However, we can see that congress does not proportionally represent the people of the United States. Our site shows how Congress' demographics do not align with the general population. Furthermore, the user is able to examine each representative based on how the following organizations, reflective their stance on particular issues, rate them:
- Abortion - Planned Parenthood
- Budget, Spending, Taxes - Americans for Prosperity
- Civil Liberties & Civil Rights - American Civil Liberties Union
- Campaign Finance - End Citizens United
- Criminal Justice - National Association of Police Organization
- Education - National Education Association
- Environment - National Parks Convervation Association
- Gun Control - National Rifle Association
- Immigration - NumbersUSA
- Marijuana - National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws
